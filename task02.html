<h1>MY OPIONION</h1>

I may not be an audiophile but I love music . I own a lot of speakers, atleast 25 pairs from different brands such as Bose, Bowers and Wilkins, B&O and KEF to name a few. The first thing I check when I buy a speaker is to see how K.S Chitra's voice come out of the speaker. (Again, I listen to tracks from different genres to see how the sound stage, imaging, detail etc are) There is no voice on earth that soothes me and makes me awestruck every time I hear it, like her music.great indianplay back singer.
